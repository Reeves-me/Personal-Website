Prompt 1

You:

when

Me:
I explained that the <option> tag was outside of the <select> and showed you a corrected dropdown menu for weekdays.

Prompt 2

You:

could you make hte css for me?

Me:
I gave you a simple CSS snippet for Bootstrap form validation (red border on invalid, green border on valid) and explained you should put it in a <style> tag in the <head> or in a separate CSS file.

Prompt 3

You:

It still doesnst show any required fields, also create teh save event button

Me:
I gave you a minimal form example using Bootstrap with required attributes and included a "Save Event" button inside the modal footer.

Prompt 4

You:

your doing to much make it simple as possible

Me:
I simplified the form validation example down to just using the required attribute (no extra JavaScript).

Prompt 5

You:

now do update locaiton as well as simple as possible f the modality for an event is "in-person", then we show a location textbox, and if it's "remote", we should show a remote url textbox.

Me:
I wrote a simple updateLocationOptions() function in JavaScript, and showed you the corresponding HTML where selecting "In-Person" shows a location input, and "Online" shows a URL input.

Prompt 6

You:

i selected online and it didnt owrk after changing all that

Me:
I reviewed your HTML, spotted mistakes (onchange=" updateLocationOptions(value)" and a typo in id="evemt_modality"). I corrected them and gave you a fixed version.

Prompt 7

You:

going back to the code for saving the event it is saying there is an error when pushing eventObj to event

Me:
I explained the error happened because you were pushing to event instead of events (the array). I showed you how to fix it.

Prompt 8

You:

walk me thorugh this part of the lab and explain it better thna they did Displaying Events on the UI...

Me:
I rewrote the lab’s instructions in clearer steps:

createEventCard() builds the event card

addEventToCalendarUI() inserts it into the correct weekday column

Showed how to use appendChild properly.

Prompt 9

You:

It isnt adding to the calendar, and when i click save changes it doenst close

Me:
I explained two issues:

You need to call addEventToCalendarUI(eventObj) with the single object, not the array.

To close the modal, you need to either use Bootstrap’s JS (data-bs-dismiss) or close it programmatically.

Prompt 10

You:

the save evnt error pooped up in the console ... createSimpleEventElement is not defined

Me:
I told you the error is because createSimpleEventElement() was missing. I gave you a simple implementation of that function.

Prompt 11

You:

it is displaying the ui wrong on the calendar

Me:
I checked your screenshot and explained the event cards were missing proper structure/labels. Suggested fixing formatting inside createEventCard().

Prompt 12

You:

make the code as simple as possible basedo nthe lab instructions

Me:
I rewrote createEventCard() and addEventToCalendarUI() in the simplest way possible: just create a <div>, fill innerHTML with template string, append it to the weekday.

Prompt 13

You:

why does the event car look like this?

Me:
I explained your card looked squished because you were appending text directly. Suggested using bold labels and line breaks.

Prompt 14

You:

the event card should look like this (with screenshot)

Me:
I updated createEventCard() to match the screenshot’s style (bold labels, stacked layout).

Prompt 15

You:

is this all correct for the js script (you pasted full code)

Me:
I reviewed your script:

Confirmed it’s mostly correct.

Pointed out you accidentally passed the whole events array to addEventToCalendarUI() instead of one eventObj.

Suggested fixing that call.

Prompt 16

You:

List all prompts that were used

Me:
I listed all your prompts in order (without outputs).

Prompt 17

You:
